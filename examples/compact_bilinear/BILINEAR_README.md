This is the bilinear pooling and compact bilinear pooling caffe implementation.
The original implementation is in MatConvNet and for convenience, we port them to Caffe. 

Sample layer prototxt: \
Bilinear layer:

    layer {
      name: "bilinear_layer"
      type: "Bilinear"
      bottom: "in1"
      bottom: "in2"
      top: "out"
    }

compact bilinear Tensor Sketch layer:

    layer {
      name: "compact_bilinear"
      type: "CompactBilinear"
      bottom: "in1"
      bottom: "in2"
      top: "out"
      compact_bilinear_param {
        num_output: 4096
        sum_pool: false
      }
    }

We only implemented the compact bilinear Tensor Sketch version without learning the random weights, since it's the best in practice. For convenience, we also implement the signed-sqrt layer and the (sample-wise) l2 normalization layer, as:
    
    layer {
      name: "signed_sqrt_layer"
      type: "SignedSqrt"
      bottom: "in"
      top: "out"
    }
and

    layer {
      name: "l2_normalization_layer"
      type: "L2Normalize"
      bottom: "in"
      top: "out"
    }
the usual use cases are compact_bilinear + signed-sqrt + l2_normalization + classification. 


For both bilinear and compact bilinear layer, two inputs could be the same blob,
i.e. in1==in2. But we always require two inputs. The two input sizes must be compatible with each other. "in1" and "in2" should have shapes: N\*C1\*H\*W and N\*C2\*H\*W respectively. Only the number of channels could be different. 

The bilinear layer always output a blob with a shape of N\*(C1\*C2)\*1\*1, i.e. bilinear features 
that is spatially sum pooled. The compact bilinear layer's output shape, on the other hand, depend on its compact_bilinear_param. In addition to the spatially sum pooled feature (output size N\*num\_output\*1\*1, we also allow the non-pooled feature (sum_pool: false, output size\: N\*num\_output\*H\*W). This could be useful in the case where one needs some spatio resolution in the output, such as keypoint detection.


There is an example of using compact bilinear feature to do birds classification in folder: $CAFFE_ROOT/examples/compact_bilinear. Please check it out!

If you want to merge the compact bilinear layer into your own caffe version, make sure you have changed all those files:

    cmake/Cuda.cmake
      add ${CUDA_CUFFT_LIBRARIES} to Caffe_LINKER_LIBS

    include/caffe/layers:
      bilinear_layer.hpp
      compact_bilinear_layer.hpp
      l2_normalize_layer.hpp
      signed_sqrt_layer.hpp
    and their corresponding .cu and .cpp files in src/caffe/layers, and tests at src/caffe/test/.

    include/caffe/util:
      _kiss_fft_guts.h
      kiss_fft.h
      kiss_fftr.h
    src/caffe/util
      kiss_fft.cpp
      kiss_fftr.cpp

    Makefile
      change the line "LIBRARIES := cudart cublas curand" to "LIBRARIES := cudart cublas curand cufft".

    src/caffe/proto/caffe.proto
      add "optional CompactBilinearParameter compact_bilinear_param=145;" in the "message LayerParameter". 

      add the following message:
      message CompactBilinearParameter {
       optional uint32 num_output = 1;
       optional bool sum_pool = 2 [default = true]; 
     }

This version of Caffe only supports cudnn v4. To use compact bilinear pooling with the latest version of cudnn (v5 at the time of writing), you have to merge the files above to Caffe master branch.
